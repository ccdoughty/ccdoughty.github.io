                <strong>Recently, I've run a suite of fixed gridsize Nyx cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to explore the convergence of the z=5.5 Ly&alpha;
                forest as a function of resolution and box size, with a focus on how it is affected by the timing of
                reionization. In the slices above, you can see how an earlier instantaneous reionization model leads to
                an increased scale for pressure smoothing; structures are more smoothed out, and below a certain scale,
                small structure is lost completely. Although it is generally assumed that the Ly&alpha; forest is converged
                at 20 kpc resolution, if reionization occurs late enough, the lack of time for the gas to thermodynamically
                respond to heat injection might mean this assumption no longer holds. <br> <br>

                In particular, we are focused on very high redshift (z>5) and at
                higher wavenumbers, where the forest is not as well converged, but where and when it is perhaps the most useful
                for learning about dark matter and reionization.</strong> <br>

                <ol>
                <li><strong>We find that the Ly&alpha; forest power spectrum does not converge within 10 percent until ~10 kpc, and
                wavenumbers larger than k>0.1 (s/km) are still not converged within this percentage. The photoionzation
                rate &Gamma;<sub>HI</sub> used to achieve the mean flux (0.05) converges by 10 kpc as well.</strong></li>

                  the photoionization rate necessary to match the selected mean flux, in units of 1e-12 s<sup>-1</sup>.

                </figure> <br>

                <li><strong>While there is a difference in the rate of convergence for instantaneous reionizations at z=6 and z=9,
                  they are not major. At 20 kpc and 40 kpc resolution the maximum percent difference
                  in the residual is 10 percent, while by 10 kpc the maximum is only 5 percent.

                  Also, while there is extra small scale power in the density field in a later reionization scenario,
                  this can be completely washed out in the power spectrum by the hotter average temperature.</strong>

              <strong>Side note: We are using ICs from Oâ€™Leary & McQuinn (2012), using an average streaming
                velocity of 30 km/s (at z~1100), as this velocity could lead to early shock heating that eliminates small
                structure. By z=5.5 we find that this only affects the power by <5 percent at most compared to &LeftAngleBracket;v&RightAngleBracket;=0 km/s.
                However, the choice of ICs can significantly impact the power, even if the choice of streaming velocity
                does not. The difference increases with higher resolution.</strong></li>
